# Landslide Susceptibility Model - Frequency Ratio Method

Landslide Susceptibility model generates landslide susceptibility as a raster layer based on six landslide causative factors.
These include slope, aspect, relative relief, curvature as raster layers and lithology and geomorphology as vector layers.  
In addition to these layers, the study area boundary and historical landslide data is required for the analysis. 

Note: The raster and vector datasets should be located in one folder. 

The model consists of three parts.
1) Part A - Preprocessing of the layers
2) Part B - Computing the frequency ratio
3) Part C - Deriving the landslide susceptibility raster
