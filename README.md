# Landslide Susceptibility Model

Landslide Susceptibility model generates the landslide susceptibility as a raster layer based on six landslide causative factors.
These include slope, aspect, relative relief, curvature as raster layers and lithology and geomorphology as vector layers.  


The model consists of three parts.
1) Part A - Preprocessing of the layers
2) Part B - Computing the frequency ratio
3) Part C - Deriving the landslide susceptibility raster
